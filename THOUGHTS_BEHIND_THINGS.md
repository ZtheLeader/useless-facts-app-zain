# 🌟 Thoughts Behind Things 🌟

The intention of writing this document is to share in-depth insights into my development decisions and experiences. I am sure it will serve the task evaluation process well. I'll try to be precise and thorough.



## 🚀 How did I plan to work on the project when I received it?


## 💻 What is the Tech Stack and why did I pick it?
Throughout my career, I've worked on and experimented with various tech stacks. I strongly believe that a developer's chosen stack speaks volumes about their development style and experience.
**Tech Stack for this Project:**
1. **[Angular v19](https://angular.dev/)**: 
2. **[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: TS has almost become a standard in industry now. They say, once you go TS, there's no going back to JS.


## 🤔 What was the most challenging part while working on it?

 ### Functional Challenges: 

 ### Non-Functional Challenges:


## 🔍 Did I follow SOLID and KISS rules? If yes, where?


## 📱 Is the application responsive?


## 🔄 Some insights about version control:
- I made frequent commits while working on this app so that my history and timeline are well-documented, allowing the reviewer to see my progress over time.
- My commit messages are inspired by commit-style suggested in [this discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3580764/7466073).  
tldr: I use **Present Tense Imperative** while writing my commit message. It starts with the type of commit eg, `feat`, `chore`, `refactor`, `fix` etc. 
- I didn't use PR based work as I was the only one working on this project. However I'm well aware of PRs and review system.

## 🛠️ Project Structure Insights:


## ❌ What does the project lack with respect to requirements?


## ⏳ What would I add more to the application if I had more time?


## 🤖 Did I take help from ChatGPT/Gemini?
I'd be lying if I say "No". :)
