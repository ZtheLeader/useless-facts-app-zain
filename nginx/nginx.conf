# nginx/nginx.conf - Final, Robust Configuration for SPA with baseHref

server {
  listen 80; # Nginx listens on port 80 inside the container

  # Set the main root directory where your Angular app's files are physically located.
  # This is where your index.html, main.js, etc., actually reside after Docker COPY.
  root /usr/share/nginx/html;

  # Ensure Nginx knows common MIME types for files it serves.
  include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
  default_type application/octet-stream; # Fallback for unknown types

  # Location block to handle requests for your application's baseHref path.
  # This is crucial for GitHub Pages deployments (e.g., /your-repo-name/).
  location /useless-facts-app-zain/ {
    # The 'alias' directive is key here: it tells Nginx to internally rewrite the path.
    # For a request like /useless-facts-app-zain/main.js, Nginx will look for /usr/share/nginx/html/main.js.
    alias /usr/share/nginx/html/;
    # This part ensures that if a file (like main.js) isn't found, it falls back to index.html
    # for client-side routing.
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
  }

  # Default location block: handles requests that don't match the specific baseHref location.
  # This is generally for direct access to the root or any other files.
  # For GitHub Pages, most traffic will hit the /useless-facts-app-zain/ location above.
  location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
  }
